# Hugo blog for 123k.pl
This is the development reporistory for my blog at [123k.pl](https://123k.pl). I followed the instructions for github user-pages and added the 
actual target-repo ([efwe.github.io](https://github.com/efwe/efwe.github.io)) as a git sub-module. This is where the hugo renders all the stuff
to and later I issue another commit to push the actual homepage.

So while this works the whole process is a little bit awkward - I produce 2 similiar commits. This all sounds
like it would be a good idea to use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for this.
