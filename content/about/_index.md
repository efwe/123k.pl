Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Frank Waldheim. I work full-time as a husband and as a dad for my daughter. Other family members are
a dog, a cat and a tortoise. Currently I live in Poland working remote as a senior software engineer at [EMPIC GmbH](https://www.empic.aero).
When I managed family and work I try to ride my bicycles.
