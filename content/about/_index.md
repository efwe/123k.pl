Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Frank Waldheim. 

I work full-time as a dad for my daughter and a cat and as a senior software engineer for [EMPIC GmbH](https://www.empic.aero).

When I have free time I walk around the woods or ride my bicycles. Besides that I love listening to music and from time to time I try to do something useful with my private computers also.

My pet projects are:
* [123k.org](https://123k.org) - my bicycle homepage
* [123k.work](https://123k.work) - my technology playground
